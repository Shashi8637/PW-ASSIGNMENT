Which of the following(s) is/are true about bubble sort:
It is stable sort
It has a worst case space complexity of O(n)
It involves swapping of adjacent elements
After each iteration, the greatest element is placed at the end of the array.


ans - 1 true 
      2 false
      3 true
      4 true


What will the following array look like after one iteration of bubble sort [1,6,2,5,4,3].
[1,3,2,4,5,6]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
[1,2,5,4,3,6]
[1,2,4,5,3,6]


ans - [1,2,5,4,3,6]

In which case does bubble sort works in the most efficient way:
When the array is sorted in increasing order
When the array is sorted partially
When the array is sorted in decreasing order.
When the array is nearly sorted.

ans - When the array is sorted in increasing order
